"""
Test suite for LLMService component.

This test suite verifies the functionality of the LLMService class, which is responsible
for managing and configuring the Language Model interactions in the RAG system. The LLMService
provides a crucial abstraction layer for working with different LLM providers and configurations.

Key Components Tested:
    - LLM configuration management
    - Settings validation and application
    - Model initialization checks
    
Test Environment:
    - Uses mock LLM configurations
    - Tests configuration validation
    - Verifies settings application
    
Dependencies:
    - BaseTest: Provides common test setup and teardown functionality
    - LLMService: Main component being tested
    
Note:
    These tests focus on configuration and setup rather than actual LLM calls
    to avoid unnecessary API usage during testing.
