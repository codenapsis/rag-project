"""
Test suite for EmbeddingManager component.

This test suite verifies the functionality of the EmbeddingManager class, which is responsible
for handling all embedding-related operations in the RAG system. The EmbeddingManager is a
critical component as it provides the semantic understanding capability through vector embeddings.

Key Components Tested:
    - Embedding model loading and initialization
    - Text-to-vector conversion
    - Batch embedding generation
    
Test Environment:
    - Uses HuggingFace embedding models
    - Tests both single and batch text processing
    - Verifies embedding quality and dimensions
    
Dependencies:
    - BaseTest: Provides common test setup and teardown functionality
    - HuggingFace transformers: For embedding model
    
Performance Considerations:
    - First-time model loading may be slow due to download
    - Memory usage depends on model size and batch size
    - GPU acceleration if available

    Test cases for EmbeddingManager functionality.
    
    This test class verifies the embedding generation pipeline, ensuring that
    text can be properly converted into vector representations for semantic
    search and similarity comparisons.
    
    This test class inherits from BaseTest which provides:
        - Common test configurations
        - Logging setup
        - Resource management
        
    Test Prerequisites:
        - Sufficient memory for model loading
        - Internet connection for first-time model download
        - Proper HuggingFace cache configuration
